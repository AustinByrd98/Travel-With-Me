Our team created a travel planning & budgeting app. The vision for the app was initially for the budgeting aspect of the app to be a unique aspect of our build. With the current version of the application we can create new users. Our users can then add & edit their trips. Users currently can only view their own trips. Users can also delete trips once they have returned from them.

To create a user they are required to provide a Name, Username, Email, & password. For users to create trips they are required to provide only a name for the trip which generates a card that doubles as a link to the details of their trip. Optionally the user may also provide details for their travel plans. They may provide transportation accommodations, Food plans, lodging accommodations, and number of people on the trip.

[Initial Project Wireframe](vscode-local:/c%253A/Users/stran/OneDrive/Desktop/Travel%2520wireframe.pdf)

Our project is ready for prestations and does meet all MVP requirements. In the future we would like to implement some more unique aspects to our project, like the ability to add other users to trips that you have planned.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
